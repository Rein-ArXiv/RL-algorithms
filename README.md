**Project Title: Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Collection**

**Overview**
A curated repository showcasing implementations of key reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, organized from the simplest toy environments to more complex, real-world-inspired scenarios. This project is intended as both a learning resource and a starting point for experimentation and benchmarking.

**Motivation**
- Existing RL repositories on GitHub often depend on outdated environment versions (e.g., Gym v0.x) rather than leveraging modern libraries like Gymnasium.
- Many examples are isolated to specific tasks, lacking a unified framework to test algorithms across diverse environments.
- This collection addresses these gaps by providing up-to-date Gymnasium wrappers, standardized interfaces, and comprehensive testing from toy problems to complex benchmarks.
